## AppsScript
### Step 1: Create a New Apps Script Project
Open Google Apps Script: Go to https://script.google.com and sign in with your Google account.

Create a New Project: Click on the "+" button to create a new project.

### Step 2: Write Your Script
Paste the script given below

```bash
function doPost(e) {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);

    // Check if it's a notification for the staff (new leave request)
    if (data.staffEmail) {
      const staffEmail = data.staffEmail;
      const studentName = data.studentName;
      const reason = data.reason;
      const startDate = data.startDate;
      const endDate = data.endDate;

      const subject = "New Leave Request Notification";
      const message = `Dear Staff,

A new leave request has been submitted by ${studentName}.

Details:
- Reason: ${reason}
- Start Date: ${startDate}
- End Date: ${endDate}

Please review the request at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.`;

      MailApp.sendEmail(staffEmail, subject, message);
    } 
    
    // Check if it's a notification for the student (leave request status update)
    else if (data.studentEmail) {
      const studentEmail = data.studentEmail;
      const studentName = data.studentName;
      const status = data.status;  // "approved" or "denied"
      const reason = data.reason;
      const startDate = data.startDate;
      const endDate = data.endDate;

      const subject = "Leave Request Status Update";
      const message = `Dear ${studentName},

Your leave request has been ${status}.

Details:
- Reason: ${reason}
- Start Date: ${startDate}
- End Date: ${endDate}

Please contact your staff member if you have any questions.

Thank you.`;

      MailApp.sendEmail(studentEmail, subject, message);
    }

    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: "success" })).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);

  } catch (error) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: "error", message: error.message })).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  }
}

```


### Step 3: Create HTML Files (Optional)
Create HTML Files: If your web app requires HTML, create files like Index.html and place them in the project.

Include HTML in doGet(e): Use HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index') to include the HTML file in your doGet(e) function.

### Step 4: Deploy Your Script as a Web App
Click on Deploy: At the top right of the script editor, click on "Deploy".

Select Deployment Type: Choose "New deployment" and select "Web app".

Fill Out Deployment Information: Enter a description, version note, and access level (e.g., "Anyone, even anonymous").

Deploy: Click "Deploy" to publish your script as a web app.

### Step 5: Access Your Web App
Copy the Web App URL: After deployment, you'll get a URL to access your web app.

Share the URL: Share this URL with users who need to access the web app.
